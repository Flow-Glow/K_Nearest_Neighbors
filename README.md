# K Nearest Neighbors

## What is K Nearest Neighbors
K-Nearest Neighbors is a supervised machine learning algorithm that can be used for classification and regression. K-Nearest Neighbor looks at diffrent classes of data and predicts what class a new data point belongs to by checking K number of the closest data points to the new data point 

1. Classification : Then finds the most frequent class label which will then become the new data point's class.
2. Regression : Then finds the mean which will then become the new data point's class.

## How K Nearest Neighbors works
1. Setting K to the chosen number of neighbors.
2. Calculating the distance between a provided/test example and the dataset examples.
3. Sorting the calculated distances.
4. Getting the labels of the top K entries.
5. Returning a prediction about the test example.
